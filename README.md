# Cyrill's CV

Certified Python developer with 3+ years of experience. Well acquainted with database engineering, data processing and Python web frameworks. I decided to pursue development after a career in journalism to have the power of technology to back my words up with. I am a self-starter, and am constantly advancing my skills on my own time in addition to my bootcamp training.

I dream of joining a team of professionals to work hard on non-trivial challenges
